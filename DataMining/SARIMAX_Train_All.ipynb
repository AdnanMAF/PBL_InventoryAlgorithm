    "# SARIMAX Forecasting: Train on `train.csv`, Forecast on `test.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow**:\n",
    "1. Import libraries.  \n",
    "2. Configure paths & parameters.  \n",
    "3. Read `train.csv` (with `sales`) and `test.csv` (future dates, no `sales`).  \n",
    "4. Loop over each product family:  \n",
    "   - Aggregate daily `sales` & `onpromotion` from `train.csv`.  \n",
    "   - (Optional) Hold out last `N_VALID` days of `train.csv` for sanity‐check metrics.  \n",
    "   - Fit SARIMAX on full `train.csv` series (log1p‐transformed), selected via `auto_arima`.  \n",
    "   - Save model to `models2/`.  \n",
    "   - Forecast exactly on the dates present in `test.csv` (using its `onpromotion`).  \n",
    "5. (Optional) Compute RMSE/MAE/R² on held‐out portion of `train.csv` and save to `performance_results2.csv`.  \n",
    "6. Save all forecasts (for `test.csv`) into `forecasts2.csv`."
